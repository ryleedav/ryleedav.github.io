                        <h2>The Word 'Tongue'</h2>
                        <p>"The Word 'Tongue'" explores the varied meanings and uses of the word "tongue," particularly in the context of Shakespeare's works. It examines the multiple definitions of the word, ranging from the anatomical organ to metaphorical uses like "fiery tongue" or "shrill-tongued." The essay delves into how Shakespeare personifies the tongue and highlights its significance in expressing thoughts, emotions, and agency. The conflicts between the tongue (speech) and the heart (emotion) in Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, illustrate how language and expression shape human experience and identity. The essay emphasizes the power and complexity of words.</p>

                        <h2>Captivating Chokecherries</h2>
                        <p>"Captivating Chokecherries," explores the symbolic role of chokecherry trees in Toni Morrison's novel Beloved, particularly through the character of Sethe. It highlights the contrast between the tree's natural beauty and the trauma Sethe experiences from slavery. The essay examines how Sethe uses nature, particularly trees, as a means of escape and healing, transforming her scars into symbols of strength. The chokecherry tree, both a reminder of loss and a symbol of resilience, serves as a pivotal element in Sethe's journey to cope with her painful past and find solace amidst her trauma.</p>

                    <h2>Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Butterfly</h2>
                    <p>Structurally based off of the poem "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird" by Wallace Stevens, "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Butterfly" was an exploration of rigid rhyme schemes. Instead of adhering to a repetitive, cliche schema, I aimed for a rather scientific, eerie, and unpredictable tone. The piece toyed with perspective with varying from first to second-person pronouns between stanzas. There wasn't a predicatable storyline or stanza trajectory to leave a broader element of tenebrosity.</p>

                        <p>The MassLive article "Without divestment, were UMass Amherst's encampments 'successful'?" examines the outcomes of spring 2024 protests at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Despite the administration's decision not to divest from certain entities, the protests led to significant administrative actions, including the issuance of trespass notices to non-affiliated individuals and strained relations between students and university leadership. The piece evaluates the effectiveness of these encampments in achieving their goals and fostering dialogue on campus.</p>
