        <h2>English and Creative Writing</h2>
            <p>I intend to display my background in close-reading papers with a creative twist. <br/> I found older, run-down books to encapsulate the general essence of the response I choose, <br/>regardless of its orgins in a Shakespeare or rhetoric course.</p>

        <h2>Coding and Software Design</h2>
            <p>I would like to display my newfound skills in Data Science in the Humanities and Advanced Software for Professional Writers. <br/> Both classes will result in new skills that I wish to display in a tangible form to future employers.<br/> The image specifically displays my wish to pursue a Master of Data Analytics and Computational Social Sciences before pursuing law.</p>

        <h2>Hero Image</h2>
            <p>I would like to use a relaxed, scenic photo as my hero image because I find sunsets to be beautiful, <br/>but also quite indicative of my mantra <i>every day is a new day.</i></p>
